## Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

<br>

The MangaStore is an app built to bring together a community of comic enthusiasts to share there work and provide a means of income to artists who enjoy the genre as well as a place for buyers to find complete works of mangas and comics without the hassle of signing up.

Most comic sites require a signed in user to buy products leading to data being sold without there knowledge aswell as sellers need to be recognized before attempting to sell there product, the mangastore aims to help stop this issue.
